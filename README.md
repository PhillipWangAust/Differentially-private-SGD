# Differentially-private-SGD

Example code accompanying my Econometrics bachelor thesis submission at the Erasmus University Rotterdam.

For the (differentially private) SGD for solving the MNIST one vs all classification problem using logistic regression, run main.m.
For the (differentially private) SGD for solving the MNIST classification problem using a two-layer neural network, run applyStochasticSquaredErrorTwoLayerPerceptronMNIST.m.

At the top of these scripts, you can change parameters like batchSize and epochs for other results.
